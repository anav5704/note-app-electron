This is a simple, native desktop note app for Windows. This app features markdown shortcuts and periodical auto saving. All the notes are saved as markdown files in the users file system in ```C:/Users/<username>/notes```. Deleting files also permanently removed the file from disk.

## Technologies Used
- Electron JS
- React JS
- TailwindCSS
